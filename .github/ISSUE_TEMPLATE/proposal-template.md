## Title
Provide a concise, descriptive title for the proposal.  
**Example**: “Proposal: Exploring Identity Wallet Interop for Pseudonymity Use Cases”

---

## Summary
Briefly describe the proposal in 1–2 sentences, capturing the core idea.  
**Example**: This proposal explores interoperability challenges for identity wallets supporting pseudonymity, aiming to identify gaps in existing standards and foster coordination among implementers.

---

## Context & Motivation
Describe the problem or opportunity this proposal addresses.  
- What specific issue or potential benefit does this focus on?  
- How does it connect to ongoing developments (e.g., authentication, authorization, wallets, privacy, standards, regulatory pressure)?  
- Why is this topic important for the group to explore?  

**Example**: Pseudonymous identity wallets are gaining traction, but lack of interoperability hinders adoption. This connects to privacy standards and regulatory trends like eIDAS, making it critical to address for user trust and market growth.
