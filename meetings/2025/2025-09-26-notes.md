**Heather Flanagan**： Good to see people here today. We are taking advantage of the Zoom tools to get the 1st pass of meeting notes. We will be cleaning that up before they are actually published. 
My name is Heather Flanagan. I am a co-chair for the exploration Interest Group. Jet Ding is the other co-chair. We are definitely globally distributed on this particular call. We have people from China, U.S and Europe. Thank you for staying up really late, or getting up really early.
We have a couple of things on the agenda today. Specifically, we wanted to hear from Philippe on Web and AI. We have a draft charter for the Web and AI Interest Group, and Roy will talk about that. We are going to talk about generative UI and MCP servers, which should be super interesting. Then we'll have some QA after each one. Does that sound right to everybody?
I need to remind you that this is a W3C group call, and we are all going to abide by the W3C Code of Conduct. I don't believe this call is going to be particularly contentious, but you never know.

**Jet Ding**： Yes, sounds good.

**Heather Flanagan**： Alright then Philippe, I think you are 1st on the list.

**Philippe Le Hegaret**： Thank you. I will share my screen, and the slides are also linked from the agenda.

What's happening has been that Artificial Intelligence is making a lot of things a lot easier, including being able to spread misinformation. But the fact is, misinformation has always existed. We didn't need to invent computers to be able to misinform the populations for that. What's new with the invention of computers is that we have been creating code for the past 78 years, and we have consciously or unconsciously called it biased into those good algorithms. AI is learning from all of that. So at the end of the day, you can't trust AI. That's for sure. But you also cannot trust the web either, because guess where the AI learned it from?

A few years ago, we published an Ethical Principle for Machine Learning. It was published by the Web Machine Learning Working Group. There is a renewed interest to make sure that these documents get properly maintained. As of today, it's only a draft. We never adopted that as a Statement yet.

Now if we look at the state of AI, the fact is it's a very fast-pacing environment. AI agent protocols are evolving constantly and really fast. There are a lot of competitions happening. For those of you who are attending the meetings at IETF in late July, you heard companies like Entrobit or Google basically saying: we're gonna keep iterating on our protocols as we're using open source projects. We're not really interested in making standards. We're certainly still climbing the hype curve of AI. I mean, let me see a lot of investments in AI, this is not going to stop soon.

As such, regulators are trying not to lag. But as I said, it's a very fast-pacing government. Ironically, standards are sent to be the one lagging at the moment when it comes down to that. Again, we are facing a very competing market. At the end of the day, we're still learning in this environment as such. You can point to a great story related to AIs, saving human lives as well as a really bad story using AIs getting rid of human lives as well. 

Why do we care about AI? Our world is getting more complex. As a user or a developer, technology is getting more and more complex. At the end of the day, we are all human. Convenience is something that all of us are looking for, because we don't have the time, and we are lazy. By default, ease of use as well as to navigate complexity is something that we are looking for, so anything that can actually lower down the cost of what we have to do on a daily basis is also something that we're looking for. We're not going to change humans in that aspect, and AI can help a lot in all of those three dimensions.

Now, why do we care about AI and the web? The web has been publishing information for the past 30 years. There has been a substantial amount of information being published, and there are a lot of services that are available on the web. AI has been leveraging the web to learn, and it's going to keep happening.

Keep in mind that most of the general models for AI nowadays, they're always at least a year behind what the state of the web is. If you download the latest LLM published and you ask what was the last date of creation, it's always from at least a year ago. If you want to make sure that your LLM is up-to-date with a specific information, you literally have to feed that information to the LLM using a rack technique on that.

Also keep in mind that a large portion of the web is not accessible through search engines. Search engines have been at best able to index 30% of the web. So we can only assume that this is the same for AI as well. It is not accessing the entire web for various reasons. For some of them, it's because it's behind payload, paywalls… not lean from anywhere, or anything like that.  There is still a vast amount of knowledge on the web that AI is catching up. But they've been working out on that.

Now, when we look at aspects of the web ecosystem, suddenly we have the people who are consuming the web or rather, the entities who are consuming the web. First and foremost, we have humans. Tim Berners-Lee said, this is for everyone back in 2012. And that remains to be true. Humans are consuming the main consumer of the web today. What we're seeing is that we are being given more and more assistance to actually help us to consume the web. We had browser extensions for a long time. We're getting more translators, and now we're getting AI agents as well, who are helping us consume the web. On the tour side, where you don't have any humans involved, is where we have been having aggregators for a long time, crawlers (search engines, AIs), etc.

AIs are also consuming the web on a regular basis. If you look at the publisher side, that dynamic is changing pretty substantially. The IAB organized a workshop in September last year, and a workshop report was updated earlier this month on AI opt-out, the relationship between a search engine and a website versus AI crawler and a website has been shifting. The IETF has been putting an AI Pref working group in place to do that, the problem is the definition of what a search engine is also a moving target, because more and more search engines are including AI. I searched, but the fact is that people don't click on links as much as they used to. It's changing the dynamic of that. 

What we are seeing is more and more deals being made from the AI companies with publishers to be able to satisfy their incentive for data. Entropique was still trying to settle their lawsuit with book authors, and even though the judge did say that it was fair use, it also said that they got to buy the book if they want to be able to get the AI to read the books, which, unfortunately for them, they haven't done. Which is why they are trying to settle for $1.5 billion on that. But he's suddenly changing the dynamic of the web. As such, reducing the incentive to publish information on the web.

AI and user applications: historically, W3C has been very focused on user applications and the user in general. It's no surprise that we are very interested in how AI interacts with user applications. It goes in two axes. 

One is how AIs actually help the application to make them more valuable. We've seen that with being able to process images like Facebook clinician, being able to process audio, being able to simply translate the text that the user is reading, and where the application can simply get itself translated using AI and so on. So that's one dimension where we should be looking into.

The other dimension is from the point of view of the user, how can the AI help the user? The user in general will phrase those in high-level queries, such as, get me a pizza and then the AI needs to figure out where they are at, what are the local pizza available in a certain radius, and figure out where the services are on the web to be able to actually complete those operations.

Sometimes, if we install AI models on our mobile phones, we certainly want to say: give me a ticket to go to a certain concert, and go and tell my friends about it. If your friends are only ever on signal, this means that your AI is accessing your signal chats, and you may want to sync twice before you are allowed to do that. It's nevertheless creating some challenges on that front.

So what do we need? We certainly need to connect the application to the AI engines available out there on that. But we also need to do the reverse. How can AIs connect to all applications, whether they're native, web, mini-apps, whatever on that. That's something that needs to be looked into.

Finally, how to connect the user itself to those AIs? Diving into that, connecting applications with AIs, it goes into two areas that we've been working on within Working Groups, or Community Groups as well. New ideas are created almost every month in that space.

There are two dimensions. One is how do we give access to an API, which allows us to load and run any type of LLM. The other dimension is, how do we give APIs to leverage existing LLMs that we do not have, that are either pre-installed available in some ways from the client side.

In the first category, how do we run your own LLM? Well, we've been working on that for the past 5 to 6 years. We have the Web Machine Learning Working Group, and the Web Neural Network API is meant to do that. It's a low-level API which allows you to run any type of LLM, so that you can actually tailor your LLM for your specific application.
One of the comments that I heard recently is how can we actually make sure that the caching of those LLMs is optimized on the client side. This solution does not address this question yet, but it does allow you to download an LLM and run it. The second is to take advantage of existing LLMs whether they are pre-installed or accessible as a service doesn't really matter from the point of view of the API. Think about it as similar to the Geolocation API. It's available on mobile phones, where it can directly access the GPS sensor. It's also available on desktops, where it's accessing a service to determine a GPS location. That's completely transparent to the application on that. 
We have a bunch of APIs in that space that are being proposed in the Web Machine Learning Community groups. Google has been doing a presentation about that at the last AC meeting back in April. Translators, summarizer, wildproof, writer, proofreader, the prompt API for web extensions is another example of that, and they are still being worked on, and it'll be fine.

Now, if we look into doing the research instead of figuring out how the AI can take advantage of the application, the AI needs to understand the application intent and be able to interact with the application. That's where agentic browsers become more advantageous. Because they can actually enable a lot of interaction between the user and the AI, and the web pages that were not possible before, whose interaction tends to be different in the sense that there tends to be conversational, task automation.

There is a lot more context around awareness in those types of browsers. In this space, tooling goes into three categories on how we can help AI connect with applications. First is by simply using AI themselves. We turn the estimate into a markdown, we run that as an input to the AI model, we take a screenshot and try to make inference out of that. We also do code analysis of the HTML code to figure out, and make inference to all of that. So that's one way to do it. It is possible, and it has been done many times. It has, however, some limitations, which I'll come back to.

Another approach is to use developer hints instead of simply using an AI to figure out the application intent and mode of interactions. We basically asked the developers to help the AI understand that by providing developer, what I call developer hints. Those can be in two spaces. When it comes down to computers, one is declarative, and the other one is programmatic using APIs. Going beyond those two approaches is the space of generative AI.

Instead of giving HTML plus CSS, choose your browser, you are basically giving the description of what your application wants, and you expect the browser to generate an AI which is tailored to the user. That's still relatively new in that space. Certainly, in the domain of accessibility, it does provide some interesting dimensions as well.

Going deeper into using developer hints, when you face a native applications, you have protocols to help you interact with native applications, MPC is a good example of that. If you want to interact with your GitHub command line, you can install an MPC server to be able to run those GitHub commands for you and get your AI to plug into it. You can also attempt to plug into the activity API available on the platform to be able to figure out what the application is able to do. 
For when the native application is a web browser itself, one interesting approach which should be explored further is to take advantage of WebDriver. WebDriver is an API that we've been working on for a long time. To be able to pilot a browser for the purpose of testing, one could imagine that you can also use WebDriver, allow the AI to use WebDriver to be able to pilot the web browsers within some limits.

When it comes down to web applications themselves, again as I said earlier, you have two spaces for that. The first one is declarative, where you're relying on the code to be able to determine what's happening, the area, which we've been working on for a long time. To be able to better express the intent of the applications for the activity purposes is a good example of that. Another way is to be able to expand to continuous work on linked data. AI models can take more and more advantage of linked data. Fabien actually did a talk in that space at the AC meeting back in April as well. 
The other space is using APIs, where we basically ask the developers to use an API to help AI understand what's happening. What we saw a few weeks ago was a proposal coming out of Microsoft and Google called WebMCP, which is using an API, you indicate how I can control your UI using an API called WebMCP.

Another API that can be used and leveraged for the purpose of AI is also the activity object model, the lower-level API for the accessibility tree available on the web platform. For server applications, you have the space of agent-to-agent protocol.
Connecting the user to AI the last dimension: What's interesting in the space of agentic applications is interaction, which is the model of interaction between the user and the application. You interact with AI through a chat, a prompt, and the AI also interacts with the users through a set of suggestions, monitoring the action from the user and being able to make suggestions at the right time to help the user. Those are the two primary modes of interaction between users and AIs.

Nowadays, it requires some human-in-the-loop type of interaction, event-driven communication, and bi-directional interaction. The other way to connect users to AI in the front-end integrations is also interesting. Where we see the need from AI to be able to interact, not just through a simple textual prompt, but also provide user interfaces as well: AGUI, MCPUI, NLWeb. I've been in that space.

How do we expose the UI to the user from an AI perspective on that? As I mentioned earlier, there is an interesting spec, which is a space of generative AI, where instead of giving an application to the user, to the browser, you give a description of this application, and you let the generative AI generate the UI for you on that. In all of those options, there is still the underlying assumption that the platform that you should use underneath, is the web platform itself. None of those is going to deprecate the use of HTML.

For example, it just means that HTML becomes the V, the actual implementation on how you deliver those things to the user, taking advantage of web engines. We hear the term a lot of Agentic web. I like to think that the web is still around to help to connect humanities. We're not here to help AIs to take over the web. We're here to make sure that the web continues to empower humanity, and that should remain at the center of what we do and how we approach, in particular, human-to-AI interaction. Because we are at W3C, we are driven by principle, and our approach should continue to be driven by such a principle.

I added a link on that last slide to the TAG discussion on AI, which happened last week during their face-to-face meeting in HongKong, and it goes into a lot more detail. I encourage all of you to have a look at it, their minutes are available.

**Heather Flanagan**： That was cool. We do have a couple of other topics on the agenda today. Let's take 2 questions for Philippe, and then we'll dive straight into the Web and AI Interest Group charter.

**Anssi Kostiainen**： Thank you for inviting this group of people together. I'd like to give you a heads-up that the WebMCP API [https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp] is actually wrapping up in the Web Machine Learning Community Group. The API is now adopted in the group charter officially, and we have bi-weekly meetings running, and there's a lot of excitement. We have a bunch of early open source contributors joining as well, who have developed prototype implementations already. We have good participation from browser vendors. We have an initial rough consensus actually, built around Google and Microsoft proposals. So I really encourage everyone to join us [https://webmachinelearning.github.io/community/#join] if you're interested.  Looking forward to growing the community interested in the agentic web.

**Tantek Çelik**： Thanks for the presentation, Philippe, I'm hoping that we can see some follow-up like the slides here documented on the wiki, or someplace that can evolve. Obviously, this is a snapshot in time. 

I wanted to raise the ongoing harm that LLM crawling traffic is doing. LLM crawling has gotten bad enough, like robots ignoring robots.txt, etc., that they don't even care that they are basically doing a denial of service attack on lots of smaller websites and even medium sized websites, where they're either slowing down or becoming inaccessible. This is one of the things that they end up doing. The IndieWeb community has been documenting examples of both, how much traffic this is causing on the web. I'll drop a link to a page collecting information about this: [https://indieweb.org/large_language_model_traffic]. 

**Philippe Le Hegaret**： To answer briefly, we can spend an entire day spending on the threats of AI. I would encourage you to look at the minutes from the TAG discussion.

**Tantek Çelik**： The reason I'm bringing this up is because this is an active harm that's happening right now. That is harming the web and that is harming the long tail of the web, harming the diversity of the web. In my opinion, it deserves a lot more attention than hypothetical future things we could do with AI, including all the new standards that are being developed. There's no point to do standards about the webinar, if the web has already been destroyed by AI. I think the overall focus in a lot of these conversations is a little misplaced. Right now this harm is actively happening, it's not theoretical. 
The current workaround for a lot of these things is basically the same problem that we had with email, which is that most people are using a proxy like Cloudflare. I can't figure this out myself. I'm just gonna use Cloudflare and so the web is gonna end up the same way the email has ended up being routed through a small number of gatekeepers because of spam. If we don't think this is a W3C problem, that's a different point. But I would say that if you care about the web and AI, this should be pretty close. This should be in your top 5 priorities.

**Philippe Le Hegaret**： This is one of the problems that we are facing indeed.

**Fabien Gandon**： Thank you for the summary. With a very broad change every day, it's not easy to deliver a short talk on that topic. I appreciate the effort. I really appreciate what Tantek said. Because it's introducing the notion of priority, and I think that really needs to be prioritized. He touched a very important topic with deep search and identity AI traffic, web business models. It's disrupting a lot of things, and I think it's a very good idea to have a place at W3C where we can put that on the radar, but also identify priorities.

When I say priorities, I have in mind things such as W3C doing picks in 1994/1995, because it's either that or the web. Maybe it's either the web will not exist next year or we will do something, so that's the kind of thing that we have in mind. I think also we need a place where we do a systematic review, not only the top headlines we hear. We need a place where we identify the impact of the AI at every level and every component of the web, not only the client, the server with services, but also the pros proxies, the catching, the entire web architecture and its component and the entire web infrastructure, the impact on routing on the internet and everything so that we have things on our radar. Then we prioritize them, keeping in mind that some of them may be lethal to the web.

We should also do that with having in mind and reviewing the values, so when we see something that is against the fact that the user agent serves the user, and does that responsibly, and explain what's going on to the user, then we should have these filter in mind something going wrong that made me harming the web. I also believe W3C is a good place to do that.

@1. They designed HCI systems and hypertext systems before, and I see the web as a rendezvous between the 2 trends, and we have a possibility. Here to mix them on the web and also to take the best of both work. I think it's a good influence to keep in mind.

**Chris Needham**： Some of the framing in what was presented seems a little bit off to me as well in terms of the user's interest to you that Fabien was speaking about security. I'm not necessarily seeing the sort of publisher concerns reflected in that too much. There're huge questions here about how this all goes forward, and the emerging really do need a good place for discussion.

I wanted to point out AI crawlers like that. There was a particular IETF session in July that talked about that. I suspect that that conversation will continue at the IETF. I don't think that should necessarily stop us also talking about these issues. I think it would be helpful that this community also discusses. For all the reasons that Tantek mentioned and Fabien also, I very much support following up either here or the new Interest Group. 

**Heather Flanagan**： Thanks Chris. I think that's actually a really good segue into discussing the charter for the new Interest Group. 

**Roy Ruoxi Ran**： The draft charter of the Web and AI Interest Group [https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/2025/webai-ig.html]

First, allow me to give some background motivation for this group. The core motivation is that AI is a really popular topic and nowadays AI is increasing, embedding into the web application browser, and also web infrastructure. In W3C, we noticed a lot of Community Groups related to AI have already been set up and people are starting to talk about the different technologies related to AI and the web.

For W3C, it looks like we don't have a formal place to talk about AI. We have the Machine Learning Working Group, mainly focusing on the web and technology, and on ethical things.

But we don't have a place to talk about AI from a strategy perspective, influence on the web, ethics, security, accessibility and privacy. So the Interest Group is under this motivation.

We set up a start to prepare this Web and AI Interest Group. At the beginning, we have already included a list of DOMs, some draft articles in our delivery report list. For example, AI impact on the web, and also DOM craft report on identical web, risk and opportunities for the web, and another document from the Web Machine Learning Working Group. That's some background of this Interest Group.

The Strategy issue [https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/511] has already been set up for a month. At this stage, we have already started the horizontal review in W3C, and got feedback from accessibility, privacy, and the internationalization review. We're still waiting for the security review feedback. We want to process the draft charter forward into the next stage, the TiLT review in the following weeks. That's some timelines for this Interest Group.

We found some candidate Chairs for this group. For the next step, we will start the W3C process to set up this group. I put this issue on the exploration IG's discussion agenda to see if there is any feedback. This is the brief introduction for this group. Welcome feedback and also further join this Web and AI Interest Group.

**Heather Flanagan**： I would like to highlight that Jet added some really interesting thoughts [https://github.com/w3c/exploration-ig/issues/8#issuecomment-3236068930] that you might want to consider in terms of how the group is scoped.

**Jet Ding**： When I read the charter, I am thinking that probably we can define the boundary between Web AI topics relevant for W3C, things like interoperability, trust, standards gaps, also make versus the areas that may be better suited for other fora. We mentioned that we cannot trust AI things, for example, AI ethics frameworks, also something like algorithmic governance.

Regarding the coordination part, we can create some links to the Privacy CG, and other groups.

Point 3 is regarding the developer community, as well as open-source AI framework maintainers. We can coordinate and contribute feedback, the standard and the market signals, so that we can benefit the stakeholders.

The last is regarding the existing specs. We have AI agents related to the stuff like web, WebAuthn, credentials, WebGPU, WebRTC, etc. We probably can do some mapping work, so that all these works can be united.

We can figure out eventually where AI use cases stress the current standards. That's all. 

**Roy Ruoxi Ran**： Thank you. I have already noticed your feedback and I try to address it as much as possible in this draft charter. We all know that AI is really a broader tool of influence to different technologies and industries. 

I have already listed liaison groups, but it's not enough yet. I will try to add more liaison groups with this Interest Group. With regard to ethics and the governance and the priorities, it will be a big topic in this group in the future, and also some impact on the web. We all have already included those topics in this chatter.

**Anssi Kostiainen**： Couple of comments here: First of all, for the ethics deliverable, I would be happy to transfer this to the Interest Group, or make it the joint deliverable between the Working Group and Interest Group. I have probably too many hats. Currently I have been editing that spec. Since we lost James (BBC), who was co-editing with me, there's a good foundation in place for that document. We need new blood to take it to the later stages, so let's work on that plan. That said, I would like to donate these ethical principles to a place where we can gather the broadest audience as contributors. If the IG is the place, let's do that. 
I've been working with some industry leaders like Margaret Mitchell who moved to hugging face a couple of years ago from Google. Marg is very interested in this space, but super busy. I'm trying to get him reactivated here. There is actually very exciting work being done at open AI around safety AI safety. I actually brought in Jay Wang to talk about this topic at TPAC last year. If I remember correctly, some of the people who moved on from Samsung have also raised interest in contributing here. There's a lot of potential, and I think the IG could be the right home.

For the ethical part, some other thoughts: I think one topic has been brought up in the Machine Learning Working Group. The Working Group is full of technical experts, and this type of horizontal topics may not be their expertise area. I've been trying to reinvigorate discussion around sustainability. I know there's a Sustainability Interest Group as well, but maybe this proposed IG could take sustainability of AI also into consideration. Just an idea in this fashion. 

Yet another horizontal, Accessibility: In the WebMCP community group that I talked about earlier, it actually does have significant positive potential to improve. Accessibility of the web I think could be transformative, someone who can work closely with, and who has time to work with the accessibility, people educate them of the benefits of AI. That would be very valuable. I'm not sure if the Exploration IG is the right place, but I would reinforce that accessibility is super important, net positive. I personally feel like the accessibility improvement is one of the top things. I can contribute to the community. So those are my thoughts.

**Roy Ruoxi Ran**： Thank you! Just a quick feedback: There is accessibility work in the APA working group and the RQTF [https://w3c.github.io/ai-accessibility/]. They try to talk about some AI and accessibility things. 
With regard to ethics, I get this idea from Dom, who is a Staff Contact for the Web Machine Learning Working Group. That's the reason why I list the Web Machine Learning Ethical in this chatter, and thank you for supporting this document transferred to the Interest Group.

**Heather Flanagan**： Looking at the time and looking at the queue, I don't think we're gonna get to our last topic. We'll figure out when we can have another meeting to follow up on that one, because I do think it is of interest.

Just a quick note: For all of these links and all this discussion, I'm going to update each of the Interest Group's issues with a link to the notes, so that you can go back. Just make sure you've covered all the things that you might want to cover.

**Tzviya Siegman**： Thank you for raising sustainability. I'm speaking as the Staff Contact for the Sustainable Web IG. One of the things that we just talked about in a sustainable web meeting this morning is how we can create more explicit guidelines in our document about AI. Because right now we talk about emerging technologies, we use broader terms. Philippe recommended that we explicitly create a paragraph about the relationship to the existing specifications or the existing notes about ethical principles in web machine learning. I think it would be a good idea for our groups to meet, whether it's the machine learning group, or this IG depending on who's working on which document. We should follow up about that because obviously there's a connection, and we need to figure out exactly who's responsible for the system and aspects of sustainability.

**Roy Ruoxi Ran**： Do you want me to add the Sustainability Interest Group to the list of liaison groups in this Web AI interest group charter?

**Tzviya Siegman**： I think that's a great idea. Thank you.

**Tantek Çelik**： Strong +1 to both. One is the suggestion to collaborate with the IG on the Ethics document. I think that's a great idea. It needs more people working on it and contributing to and also strong +1 to the suggestion of adding the Sustainability IG. It would be great to see the WSG adding a section on AI usage, the current known harms that are occurring from energy usage to firing up new carbon-based power plants to building data centers in areas, and like depleting their water aquifers. There's just a lot happening right now. I think it is urgent enough to include in a section about thinking your business is being sustainable.

You might want to check on which AI you're using, and the harms that it's doing right now to sustainability. I will add to that in case it's of interest to folks. If there're future thoughts like proposals for AI and such, we do have a small horizontal review project in progress [https://www.w3.org/wiki/Sustainability#Sustainability_Horizontal_Review] at the sustainability CG. 

**Heather Flanagan (she/hers)**： Thank you. So there was a lot of good information in this session. We've got some interesting actions that are going to come out of it in terms of what the groups will do, and some different ways to move forward. 

**Philippe Le Hegaret**： The thing that I'm hearing the most here is that we need to start this Web and AI IG sooner rather than later. I've been telling Roy for the past few weeks that there is an urgent need to have those conversations. While I didn't mean to downplay the problem raised by Tantek, I just meant to say it requires a lot more conversations, and yes, having the Web and AI IG to continue those conversations would be necessary. We need to have this IG starting ASAP.

**Roy Ruoxi Ran**： I will start the review as soon as possible.
